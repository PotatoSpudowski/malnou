India suffers due to droughts every year. Droughts tend to have a huge impact on malnutrition, especially in children.

The children living in these drought-affected areas suffer from malnutrition even years after the drought has occurred. The government has established Anganwadi schools to help provide care to these children. Although the malnutrition rates have reduced, the system is not fully efficient. 

After speaking to the workers and staff in these anganwadis and the parents of these children, we were able to identify these 3 main problems.

## Problems

1. Lack of motivation to do extra work because the Anganwadi staff get a fixed salary irrespective of how much work extra work they do.

2. It's very difficult to keep a track of the health of children that belong to migrant workers as they keep changing their place of stay every few weeks.

3. Parents withdraw their children from anganwadis as they are abused by the staff and the parents feel powerless to stand up to the staff. They feel it's easier to just withdraw the child from the Anganwadi.

## Solutions

Our project consists of a multipart solution to address these above problems.
